### CodeTyke 

Please create a progress bar to accompany the sequence of questions. The progress bar should have a small purple circle on the first question. By the last question, the progress bar should be 75% filled. With the current implementation, the user will never see a 100% full progress bar. 

Use this image as your design reference. Please take care to implement the design as precisely as possible.
